#React Fullstack app with Express / Node backend, React Router, Styled-Components and React-Icons

##Starting the Backend##

Express.js server serving backend api files

install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`

To start server use `yarn start` @ project root (not in `/client` dir)

Please include '/api/' in all api routes as best practice and to distinguish from routes that are to be used by react router.

##Starting the Client##

change into '/Client' directory `cd /client`

install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`

to start the server in development use

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

##Styled Components##

Adjust global stylesheet in ./client/src/Theme.js to your own needs

Styles should be automatically globally accessible throughout the frontend with the current set up.

for more on Styled Components see https://styled-components.com

##React-Icons##

This package includes the standard most widely used SVG icons and makes life much easier

For a full list of available icons see here - https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
